/**
 * Project service to store the mappings between tag and category names. Each tag name is assigned to a category and stored as a separate
 * entry. The following assignments in the plugin Settings
 * <pre>
 * Test Suite=smoke,regression,e2e
 * Device=mobile, tablet, desktop
 * </pre>
 * will be stored in the underlying mapping as:
 * <pre>
 * smoke -> Test Suite
 * regression -> Test Suite
 * e2e -> Test Suite
 * mobile -> Device
 * tablet -> Device
 * desktop -> Device
 * </pre>
 * This service is initialized when the tool window's {@link GherkinTagTreeModel} is being first built and it requests
 * a mapping by calling {@link #categoryOf(String)}.
 * <p>
 * During initialization, tag names are trimmed to allow storing them in the app and project level
 * settings, with a leading whitespace, e.g. {@code smoke, regression, e2e} instead of {@code smoke,regression,e2e}.
 * <p>
 * Tag names are stored in a case-sensitive way (may change in the future) and without the leading @ character.
 *
 * <h2>Regex based tags</h2>
 * It is not just exact tag names that can be assigned to categories but regex patterns as well. They must be defined
 * starting with the # symbol to have them recognized as regex patterns.
 * <p>
 * One example is Jira ticket ids in which case the mapping looks like
 * <pre>
 * Jira=#^[A-Z]+-[0-9]+$
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * So, any tag name that matches this pattern will be added to the Jira category. If there is more than one category
 * this same pattern, or one yielding the same matches is added to the registry, upon querying the one added earliest
 * is returned and used as the tag's category.
 *
