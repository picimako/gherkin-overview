<h4>0.2.0</h4>
<strong>New</strong>
<p>
    Added support for JBehave Story files:
<ul>
    <li>.story files are now also recognized in projects, given that the <a
            href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16716-gherkin-overview">JBehave Support</a>
        plugin is installed, since that plugin provides the language support for JBehave Story files.
    </li>
    <li>Renamed the <strong>Gherkin Tags</strong> tool window to simply <strong>Tags</strong> to reflect that it is not
        just Gherkin files that the tool window can display.
    </li>
    <li>In the tool window, the root element's name reflects whether Gherkin and/or JBehave Story files are available in
        the project.
    </li>
</ul>
